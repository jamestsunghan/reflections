Q1 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


It creates a hidden git directory, and it allows us to use version-control.

Q2 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?



It is an area that store your changes temporary, and it allows us to choose which files need to be commit at the same time in order to trace back logically.

Q3 How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?



Check it by using "git diff" and "git diff --staged" to double check the changes before actually commit all the files. 

Q4 What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?



If you want to try some functions of versions which is experimental or aside from the main feature,we may use branches to try out, and it will make the least impact for the main versions.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?



What is the result of merging two branches together? 

Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?



What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
